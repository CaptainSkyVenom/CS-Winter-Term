# Notes on Github Winter Term

Why do we create branches?
So we can make changes to the code without disrupting other people's work.
How do we create and use branches?
Click create branch.
Make changes on the branch and commit to log changes of the file.
You can pull from master into your branch to incorporate other people's edits from the master branch.
You can then create a pull request to pull from your branch into master, and eventually merge it into master branch.

Commit with a meaningful description so you can easily find the commit if you want to revert.

To "revert", checkout to the commit that you want to revert to, copy the contents of the file you want to revert, and replace it on the file after checking back out to the original location.

Fetch from source to update what other people have done.
